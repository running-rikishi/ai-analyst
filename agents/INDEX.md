**Note on template-only placeholders:** The ML ship-decision agent fills additional `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` strings inside `agents/templates/build_results_*.md` at render time (e.g., `{{PRIMARY_METRIC_VALUE}}`, `{{ANCHOR_VERDICT}}`, `{{BACKTEST_AVG}}`). These are NOT system variables — they're computed-at-render values local to the template substitution step. Don't declare them here.

## Agents

| Narrative Coherence Reviewer | `agents/narrative-coherence-reviewer.md` | After Story Architect produces the storyboard, before charting — reviews story flow, beat structure, and Closing beats if present |
| Storytelling | `agents/storytelling.md` | Analysis and charts are complete, need a narrative |
| Source Tie-Out | `agents/source-tieout.md` | After Data Explorer, before analysis — verify data loading integrity by comparing pandas direct-read vs DuckDB SQL on foundational metrics. HALT on mismatch. |

| Comms Drafter | `agents/comms-drafter.md` | Need stakeholder communications (Slack summary, email brief, exec summary). Non-critical — pipeline continues if this fails. |
| ML Model Evaluation | `agents/ml-model-evaluation.md` | Need to evaluate an ML model on panel data — runs forward-chaining CV with entity-aware splits, produces aggregated metrics, distribution shift diagnostics, and pass/fail verdict against success criteria. |
| ML Feature Prep | `agents/ml-feature-prep.md` | Starting any tabular ML build — applies feature hygiene + smart imputation + leak audit + target profiling. Task-type-aware. Halts on out-of-scope inputs (DL, LLM, CV, sequence). |
| ML Model Train | `agents/ml-model-train.md` | Training a tabular supervised ML model end-to-end. Routes CV / tuning / calibration / SHAP by `TASK_TYPE` × `DATA_STRUCTURE` × `ALGORITHM`. Sample-size-adaptive halt rules. Produces calibrated ensemble + SQLite Optuna study + task-aware eval report. |
| ML Ship Decision | `agents/ml-ship-decision.md` | After ML model is trained — runs ml-baseline-gate + shap-rep-explanations + rolling-backtest. Produces BUILD_RESULTS.md (templated by `DECISION_FRAME`) and structured build_metrics.json. |
| ML Productionize | `agents/ml-productionize.md` | After ml-ship-decision returns SHIP — verifies production readiness and generates a concrete migration plan (file checklist, per-stack customizations) per AGENTS_ML.md. Halts on unsupported stacks, ship-verdict failure, or missing artifacts. |

## Reference Docs

| Doc | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| AGENTS_ML.md | `agents/AGENTS_ML.md` | Vendor-neutral production-ML pipeline reference. Covers repo architecture, modular SQL, atomic warehouse writes, watermark + auto-backfill, train/predict DAGs, three-output table convention, DQ checks, and stack-adaptation points. Referenced by `ml-productionize`. |
| FRAMEWORK_GAPS.md | `agents/FRAMEWORK_GAPS.md` | Consolidated wishlist + scope statement. Tier 1 (hard out-of-scope, with halt redirects), Tier 2 (soft gaps), Tier 3 (template extensions), Tier 4 (stack extensions). Read first if your use case might not fit. |
